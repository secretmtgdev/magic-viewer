# Magic Viewer

## Description

Just a simple project that I'm creating to showcase some of my EDH decks.

## Progress

### April 3, 2023

Today is a big milestone. I really admire EdhRec and the pricing that they've setup. So, using ScryFall's SDK and a little bit of react/css average prices of the cards have been placed.
